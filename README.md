## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![](https://github.com/fuentesjo6/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/linear_regrssion.png)

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  - We can see from the above figure that the vehicle length and the ground clearence coefficients have a high level of significance in predicting miles per gallon (MPG). 

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  - The slope would be considered zero since it is such a small number.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

  - The linear regression model of residual standard error: 8.774 which is ok at predicting the MPG for the Mechacar.



## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils ðŸ§°

  - The coils for the Mechacar suspension state that the variance must not exceed 100 PSI. As the image below shows the variance does not exceed 100 PSI for the avereage of the lots.

  - The variance for the individual lots is a different story, as the image shows below lots 1 and 2 were well below the 100 PSI variance standard with a variace of 0.979 for lot 1 and 7.46 for lot 2. Lot 3 however was well above the maximum PSI varaice allowed with a variance of 170.28.
